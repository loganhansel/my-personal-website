        <p>Hello, world! I'm Logan and you are currently visiting 
            the <b>first</b> project of my coding career. Now it might not look 
            like much at the moment, but this site will grow in presentation 
            just as I will come to grow as a developer.</p>

        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Indiana, I've lived a fairly quite and simple life. 
            Immediately after graduating high school I worked in restraunts 
            and manufacturing, and always felt I wanted more out of my skillset 
            and the jobs I choose to do. Outside of my work I loved building computers 
            and had a growing feeling that I should enter the field of tech professionally. 
            This was when I decided to enroll in Flatiron School! Now I am 
            passionate about becoming a full-stack web developer and excited to 
            be on this journey with you all!</p>
